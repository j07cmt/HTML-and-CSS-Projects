	<p>HTML Entities are used to display special characters reserved in HTML. Some characters can confuse the browser, such as the lesser than or greater than character can make the browser incorrectly view them as a tag.
	<br>
	To get around this, we can use an entity name or entity number
	<br>
	For example, I like to visit Japan, so if I wanted to write a blog and use the &yen; symbol, I could write <code><b>&amp;yen;</b></code> (entity name) or <code><b>&amp#165;</b></code> (entity number)in my code to tell the browser to display the character without affecting any code.</p>
