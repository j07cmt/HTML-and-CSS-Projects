			<h1>Scuba Diving Certification Agencies</h1>
				<p>There are a number of agencies that provide training a certification for all levels of scuba diver, from beginner to expedition level.
				<br>
				Here is a list of the most popular training agencies<p>
				
				<ul>

					<li>RAID</li>
					<li>BSAC</li>

				<p><b>PADI</b> <span class="fullname">(Professional&nbsp;Association&nbsp;of&nbsp;Diving&nbsp;Instructors)</span> is the largest organisation in the diving industry, certifying more divers than all the other agencies combined. 
				I am certified by <b>PADI</b> and <b>SDI|TDI</b> <span class="fullname">(Scuba&nbsp;Diving&nbsp;International&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Technical&nbsp;Diving&nbsp;International). <b>SDI|TDI</b> train all levels of diverm but through <b>TDI</b>, they train technical divers - the ones that do it deeper, and longer.<p>

			<h1>Scuba Diving Locations</h1>
				
				<p>Scuba diving takes place all around the world. With the earths surface being 71% water, there are thousands of recognised dive sites around the world, in all five of our oceans. I have dived all around the British&nbsp;Isles, the&nbsp;Red&nbsp;Sea, and the Gulf&nbsp;of&nbsp;Thailand. I absolutely love diving with large pelagic species such as sharks, rays, and ceteceans. My main interest though is wreck diving, and my ultimate goals are to identfy a previously unnamed shipwreck by location the bell, and diving on the sister ship to the Titanic, the Britannic.</p>
