	<h1>Scuba Diving</h1>

		<p>Scuba diving is my favourite hobby. I love the adventure of the underwater world. I have explored reefs and shipwrecks all around the United Kingdon, Egypt, and Thailand.

	<h3>Scuba Diving Equipment</h3>
		<p>I have lots of scuba diving equipment, some for diving in cold water, and some for diving in warm water.</p>
	<h6>Stay safe when scuba diving and take classes to gain qualification and experience with a certified instructor</h6>
	<p>Here is a quote from SSI's website:</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://www.divessi.com/en/home">
	With 71% of the earth being covered with water, it is no wonder we are so fascinated with what lies beneath the surface. In fact, scientists estimate that there are nearly 1 million different species of aquatic animals.
